# Discount Codes Api ✈️
A simple api to generate discount codes and fetch discount codes. It is built using python 3.10 and Flask 2.2

## What it does?
It is a small part of a customer loyality app. It has 2️⃣ microservices accessible via REST API: 1) Generate Discount Coderuns 2) Fetch discount code for a user. 

## What it consist of?
A development web server and two microservices ✈️

## Development stack?
Python 3.10, Flask 2.2 (web framework), SQLAlchemy (ORM) and Marshmallow (serialization). In this project SQLite database is used that can be replaced with other database type.

## Setup Instruction

* Install the libraries and setup the database

- Setup the Python 🐍 virtual environment (I have assumed that Python 3.x is already installed on your system)
  - ```python3 -m venv simpleapi``` (this will create a folder name simpleapi, replace it with any other name if you like)
  - goto simpleapi 📁
  - activate the venv by entering this command at command prompt: ```source bin/activate```
  - Install the dependencies
  - ```pip3 install Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, flask-marshmallow``` (refer to requirement.txt 📄)
- Lets run the app 💻 and test the endpoints using Postman 🏤 or web browser 🌍
  ```
  flask run
  ```


## Database Commands
SQLite database loyality.db is used by the app. During development/testing you can create the Database, Drop it and Seed it with initial data

| Action         | Command                       |
|---------------:|-------------------------------|
| Create Database| flask --app db_setup db_create|
| Drop Database  | flask --app db_setup db_drop  |
| Seed Database  | flask --app db_setup db_seed  |

Note: commands should be entered in simpleap folder at command prompt

## Run the App
1. ```python3 app.py``` OR
2. ```flask run```

The above command will run the development web server **http://localhost:5000** where you can test the API endpoints
